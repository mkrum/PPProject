## Games

For this project, we have worked on two games that are similar.

The game we originally set out to make is in the area-game folder. This game is more complex than the other, but unfortunately it has some major bugs. Concerned that this game would not work by submission time, we simplified and modified the game into light-cycle as a backup plan. We did not want to end up submitting something that did not work. We are including both games in our submission because although area-game is not fully working, we spent most of our time trying to get it to work and we thought it was worth including to show our effort.

View the two game folders for code and more detailed READMEs.
